 <h1>The Best Movies According to India</h1>

 <h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
 <hr />
 
 <h3>Paddington</h3>
 <p>A very cozy movie that made me feel like the world was a soft place when I was going through a difficult time.</p>
 
 <h3>Platoon</h3>
 <p>Pretty much the polar opposite of Paddington in every way, shows the fragility of one's own humanity when placed in unbearable circumstances.</p>
 
 <h3>The Old Guard</h3>
 <p>It's got love, action, found family, immortality, and a great soundtrack.</p>
